Run the server from one computer using the command:
	python main.py server
Run the client from another computer using the command:
	python main.py client <hostname>

The program will run a version of "galaga" with two players; players can use the left and right arrow keys to move back and forth and use the spacebar to shoot the enemies.  New enemies will appear with greater frequency as the game progresses and drop bullets that the players have to avoid.
